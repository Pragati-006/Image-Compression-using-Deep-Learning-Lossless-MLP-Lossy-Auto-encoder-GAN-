# Image-Compression-using-Deep-Learning-Lossless-MLP-Lossy-Auto-encoder-GAN-

This project aims to address the growing need for efficient image compression techniques due to the exponential increase in data generation. The focus is on exploring and implementing deep learning methodologies for both lossless and lossy image compression. By leveraging advanced neural network architectures such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Autoencoders (AEs), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the project seeks to enhance compression ratios and improve image reconstruction quality.

Purpose:

    Improve Compression Ratios: To achieve better compression rates than traditional methods by minimizing data redundancy without compromising image quality.
    Enhance Image Reconstruction Quality: To ensure high-quality image reconstruction, particularly for lossy compression, using sophisticated neural network models.
    Evaluate Deep Learning Architectures: To investigate the effectiveness of different neural network architectures, including MLPs for lossless compression and CNN-based autoencoders and GANs for lossy compression.
    Benchmark Against Traditional Methods: To compare the performance of the proposed deep learning models with conventional compression algorithms like JPEG and JPEG-2000.
    Future Directions: To identify potential areas for further improvement in compression algorithms, including alternative loss functions and generative models for more efficient data representation.
